# ðŸŽ¯ Seamless Serato Integration System

## Overview

The Seamless Serato Integration System enables DJs to connect their Serato account once and have all mission verification, payment processing, and proof logging happen automatically in the background. **DJs do nothing extra** - they just play music as normal in Serato.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### 1. One-Time Serato Connection
- DJ connects Serato account to Club Run via OAuth (like connecting Spotify to Instagram)
- After connection, no manual check-ins, QR codes, or photo uploads required
- Connection persists until manually disconnected

### 2. Mission Creation with Track Requirements
- Curator/label creates mission with specific track requirements
- Mission includes:
  - Track title, artist, album, ISRC code
  - Duration, BPM, key (optional)
  - Time window for verification
  - Venue/location requirements
  - Budget and payment method

### 3. Automatic Verification Process
- When DJ accepts mission, verification is scheduled for the mission window
- Club Run automatically checks Serato play history after the gig
- System verifies:
  - Required track was played within time window
  - Track matches requirements (title, artist, duration, etc.)
  - Play history indicates professional gig patterns
  - Venue/location matches (if supported)

### 4. Seamless Completion
- If verification succeeds: Automatic payment + proof logging
- If verification fails: Mission marked as incomplete, no payment
- DJ receives notification of completion/failure
- Curator gets detailed proof report

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Backend Services

#### 1. SeratoIntegrationService (`backend/src/services/serato/SeratoIntegrationService.js`)
- Handles OAuth connection with Serato
- Manages access token refresh
- Retrieves play history from Serato API
- Verifies track matches against requirements
- Calculates confidence scores for matches

#### 2. MissionVerificationService (`backend/src/services/verification/MissionVerificationService.js`)
- Queues missions for verification
- Processes verification tasks in background
- Handles automatic payment processing
- Manages proof document creation and IPFS storage
- Sends notifications to DJs and curators

#### 3. Serato Routes (`backend/src/routes/serato.js`)
- `/api/serato/connect` - Initiate OAuth connection
- `/api/serato/callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- `/api/serato/status` - Check connection status
- `/api/serato/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `/api/serato/disconnect` - Disconnect account

## ðŸŽµ Track Verification Logic

### Matching Criteria
1. **Title Match** (40% weight)
   - Exact match: 40 points
   - Partial match: 30 points

2. **Artist Match** (30% weight)
   - Exact match: 30 points
   - Partial match: 20 points

3. **ISRC Match** (20% weight)
   - Exact match: 20 points

4. **Duration Match** (10% weight)
   - Â±2 seconds: 10 points
   - Â±5 seconds: 5 points

### Professional Gig Detection
- Minimum 10 tracks played
- Consistent timing between tracks (max 5-minute gaps)
- Reasonable track durations (1-10 minutes)
- Venue information present

### Confidence Threshold
- **70%+ confidence**: Mission completed automatically
- **<70% confidence**: Mission marked as failed

## ðŸ’° Payment Processing

### Automatic Payment Flow
1. Mission verification succeeds
2. Payment service processes transaction
3. DJ receives payment via specified method
4. Proof document uploaded to IPFS
5. Mission marked as completed
6. Notifications sent to DJ and curator

### Payment Methods Supported
- USDC (Crypto)
- MATIC (Crypto)
- Cash App
- Zelle
- Venmo
- PayPal

## ðŸ“Š Proof Documentation

### Proof Document Structure
```json
{
  "missionId": "mission_123",
  "runnerId": "runner_456",
